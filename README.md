# WP Genderize

The plugin which genderizes strings for WordPer and WordPress

## Features:
- Allow to use gendered strings for users and objects in local language
- Support for male, female and neutral genders for objects
- User's gender can be set in the profile settings

For example, in french (fr_FR), it'll display `Publiées` in page context instead of `Publié`.

## History

The plugin was created after [this reflexion](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42725) about gender in many locales.

It will evolve depending on this [other proposal](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42725) about user's gender.
